Steven Mayer: Hey Anas Ahmed, Thank you for the update! 

1. You need a login to a Walmart account? 
2. Ya I submitted everything but it says theyâ€™ll review all our information and it could take 4-6 weeks and then theyâ€™ll let us know if weâ€™re approve or not. It was more like just a request to be approved and not an actual approval. So im assuming they have 1000s of people apply and have to review them all.
3. @Mike VC Will post that in here shortly

Mike VC: The domain will be joinwally.com
Mike VC: Are you building it on a separate domain then we will just migrate it?

Anas Reaz: 1. Yes to connect and play around with
Anas Reaz: We can just put a lander there for now, and use this domain so you guys can test it essentially

Anas Reaz: Eg. Test.Joinwally.com could be the url for testing
Mike VC: that works - so you need access to it then or not yet?
Anas Reaz: Yes, we need access to it
Anas Reaz: You can share access to developer@outorigin.com
Anas Reaz: Add as a user to your domain hosting account eg. Godaddy
Mike VC: Ok its just parked in godaddy with no hosting/wordpress so want me to set that up too or do you need WP

Anas Reaz: No hosting required
Mike VC: Ok
Anas Reaz: We just want to have access to we can point it to the server we are setting up
Mike VC: Do you know how to give access to one specific domain? Since we have lots in here haha!
Mike VC: right makes sense
Anas Reaz: Actually if you are tech savvy, we can just provide you with instructions. You can put the DNS records and point it to the server. Would that work?
Mike VC: Yep that works perfect
Anas Reaz: Then we don't need to get access ðŸ˜…

Mike VC: Ok yep easy enough -
